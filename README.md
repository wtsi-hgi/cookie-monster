# cookie-monster
The cookie-monster is a daemon meant to monitor any new file uploads or changes to the existing files in iRODS within a time frame. It analyses the list of files that have changed in order to decide which changes are of interest for Human Genetics teams and then pushes further the files of interest to the processing pipelines.
