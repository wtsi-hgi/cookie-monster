# cookie-monster
The cookie-monster is a daemon meant to monitor any new file uploads or changes to the existing files in iRODS within a time frame. It receives the list of changes, process it in order to decide which ones are of interest for Human Genetics teams and then pushes further to the processing pipelines the list of files of interest as messages.
